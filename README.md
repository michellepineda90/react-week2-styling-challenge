# React Week 2 Styling Challenge

This was the project for the React Week 2 Challenge of the React JS Nerdery.

It still needs some major refactoring, but you can visit the app [here](https://michellepineda90.github.io/react-week2-styling-challenge/).

This project was built using React and [react-chartjs-2](https://react-chartjs-2.js.org/).
